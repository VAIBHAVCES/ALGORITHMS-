# ALGORTHIMS

## PURPOUSE 
* I am currently preparing for my coding interview so for now purpouse of repo is to just document what I do .
* I generally write a little aproach note with every question so that if you want any hint or you wanna recall solution prefer using it
* I genrally try to find all solutions from discussion and try to  put all solutions together so that we can understand multiple aproaches at one place
* Forgive me if forgot to add explaination , spelling mistake , and any other mistake 

## DO YOU WANNA CONTRIBUTE ?
* I would love if you can contribute
* Please ensure you are adding solutions and explainations to only those problems which are already present
* For now I am not accepting new problems 
* You can add new methods , improved explainations , formulaes etc  anything but not new questions ( for now only) 

## FUTURE PLANS 
* I have motive of extending this repo to all availaible coding platforms
* For now it holds only leetcode and gfg solutions 
* But sooner or later I will expand it to competitve programming and contest solutions
